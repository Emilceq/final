        <p class="smoke">“I’m a boss,” says Smoke Dogg as he lays on his side, head propped up on his shoulder. He lies on the bed of his camper van turned mobile weed-lollipop business. The bright green van, adorned with pictures of marijuana is hard to miss. It’s one of several that can be spotted roaming the streets of New York City marketing themselves as purveyors of top-quality weed edibles. The “Chronic Lollipops” come in such flavors as O.G. Kush, Sour Diesel and Purple Haze –all names of popular strands of the psychedelic, devil’s lettuce. Though the trucks and vans are plastered in pictures of the sticky plant, none of their products contain THC –the stuff that gets you high. “We use hemp and hemp is legal in most states,” said Smoke in his gruff, smoky, southern drawl.</p>
        <p class="business">The business is Weed World Lollipops. It’s a franchise that can be purchased for $10,000. </p>
        <p class="smoke">"It’s worth it,” he said reassuringly. “It’s gotta be worth it. They’re legalizing marijuana all over the country and they’re making billions off of it.” Smoke’s been traveling all over the United States in his bright green camper van for three years now.</p>

       <p class="smoke">“Business is always good. It’s slow at times like any other business, but it’s good,” said O.G. Purp, another weed lollipop vendor. “They’ll get you nice for about an hour once it kicks in,” he said, deflecting the question of whether the lollipops had any THC in them like a seasoned politician.</p>
       <p class ="business">Business is good for these guys, that’s undebatable.</p>
       <p class ="smoke">In just five minutes of standing by the sales window of the van, over $100 of worth of sales were made. And these pot pops aren’t cheap, they retail at five bucks each. The vans also sell brownies and cookies for $10. It’s hard to believe that they have regular customers once clients find out that all the weed buzz renders just a slight buzz at best. But neither Smoke Dogg or O.G. Purp seemed to be too worried about customer satisfaction. In regards to dissatisfied customers, O.G. responded, “That’s with every company. Some people don’t like McDonald’s. No matter what you do, there’s gonna be somebody that hates on you.”</p>

        <p class="smoke">"I would never buy another lollipop from them again and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone unless I was trying to screw that person over," said Manuel Martinez with a laugh. Martinez, a 20-year-old Illustration major at Parsons School of Design, says he bought two lollipops a couple years ago for $10 and felt that "it was fake." "I didn't feel anything," he said, "they marketed the lollipops to me as something that would get me high but they didn't."</p>
        <p class="smoke">"I don't feel the need to waste money on weed propaganda...weed lollipops don't even taste good so there's no real point for me," said Alexandra Antoniou, a 21 year old Journalism + Design major at The New School. "We bought lollipops expecting to get high. The vendors told us there was weed in them... I think the business would be honest and fair if they were upfront that it wouldn't get you high."</p>
        <p class="business">Three out of the four vendors interviewed for this article did say that the lollipops would get you high. A statement which is entirely untrue.</p>
        <p class="smoke">The lollipops do, however, have a distinct skunky flavor. Not quite the flavor of marijuana but more like a sprig of rosemary was kept in a moist jar until it caught a funky mold or an intense pine sol-like oil.</p>

          <p class="smoke">The Weed World Candy vendors are able to sell their edibles because they don't contain THC, the chemical compound that gets you high but they do contain trace amounts of cannabidiol or CBD. CBD is not psycho-active but it has shown a lot of medical benefits. According to the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, "CBD acts in some experimental models as an anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, anti-oxidant, anti-emetic, anxiolytic and antipsychotic agent, and is therefore a potential medicine for the treatment of neuroinflammation, epilepsy, oxidative injury, vomiting and nausea, anxiety and schizophrenia, respectively."</p>
          <p class="smoke">Officer McGrath of the NYPD's 13th precinct says him and his guys know that the vendors aren't selling anything illegal so they "don't really mess with them much." He did say that he doesn't support the message they're conveying to children. "In my personal opinion, I think that they're sending the wrong message to kids by selling the candies which attracts them and making them believe that using marijuana is ok. It's not ok."</p>
          <p class="smoke">All in all, the pot pops aren't going to get you high in any way but maybe, if you're feeling queasy or schizophrenic, the CBD's in them might help.... at best.</p>
